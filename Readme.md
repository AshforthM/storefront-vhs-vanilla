## Running the app
If you want to run this on your local machine and play with your own create, update and delete functionality, you will need your own Firebase Realtime Database, which you can set up for free [here.](https://firebase.google.com/)

Create a new Realtime Database, go to your firebase project settings, and copy your firebaseConfig keys into a new .env file at the root of the project. Run 'npm install' in your project to install dependencies, and the app should launch properly on 'npm start'. You can now add your own products!
